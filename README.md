A lightweight yet powerful desktop app that extracts data from invoices in **PDF** or **JPG** format with over **95% accuracy**. This is possible using a mix of **OCR**, **Generative AI (Gemini)**, and smart processing — all bundled into a single `.exe` file!

---

## 📦 Features

- 💡 Intelligent extraction using **Google Generative AI**
- 📄 Supports **PDF** and **JPG** invoice formats
- 🧠 Uses `pytesseract`, `pdfplumber`, and `pdf2image`
- 📊 Exports structured data to **Excel**
- 🖼️ Intuitive **Tkinter GUI**

🧠 How It Works
- PDFs are read using pdfplumber. If text extraction fails, it switches to OCR using pytesseract.
- Extracted text is sent to the Gemini API with a prompt for field extraction.
- Parsed response is saved to combined_data.json and converted to an Excel file.
- All weights are converted to kilograms.
