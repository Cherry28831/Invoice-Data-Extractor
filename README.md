A lightweight yet powerful desktop app that extracts data from invoices in **PDF** or **JPG** format with over **95% accuracy**. This is possible using a mix of **OCR**, **Generative AI (Gemini)**, and smart processing — all bundled into a single `.exe` file!

---

## 📦 Features

- 💡 Intelligent extraction using **Google Generative AI**
- 📄 Supports **PDF** and **JPG** invoice formats
- 🧠 Uses `pytesseract`, `pdfplumber`, and `pdf2image`
- 📊 Exports structured data to **Excel**
- 🖼️ Intuitive **Tkinter GUI**
- ⚙️ Backend logic is bundled — **no additional installation needed!**

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack & Libraries Used

- [`pdfplumber`](https://github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber)
- [`pdf2image`](https://github.com/Belval/pdf2image)
- [`pytesseract`](https://github.com/madmaze/pytesseract)
- [`google-generativeai`](https://github.com/google/generative-ai-python)
- `tkinter` (GUI)
- `pandas`, `openpyxl` (Excel generation)

---

🧠 How It Works
- PDFs are read using pdfplumber. If text extraction fails, it switches to OCR using pytesseract.
- Extracted text is sent to the Gemini API with a prompt for field extraction.
- Parsed response is saved to combined_data.json and converted to an Excel file.
- All weights are converted to kilograms.

> ✅ Since we bundled `backend.py` into the final executable, there is **no need to install any libraries** or set up Python locally. Everything runs from the `.exe` — plug and play!
